**Be Right Back**
***Building Results Boss!***

## Preword

I’ve always been focused on finding practical ways to solve real problems and continuously improve my skills. My experience in areas like cloud infrastructure and microservices has given me a strong understanding of how different parts of a system work together to create seamless, user-friendly experiences. Recently, I’ve been diving deeper into front-end development, and it feels like a natural next step in my journey.

I find that diving into challenges is the best way I grow—every problem I tackle helps expand my skill set and brings me closer to delivering better solutions. It usually starts with a deep breath, a bit of relief once it clicks, and then... “What’s next?”

I’m always eager to learn and open to exploring new possibilities. When I face a problem, I’m ready to take it on, push through that “have I seen this before?” moment, and hopefully improve things for everyone involved. Plus, I’ve believe that outside self learning leads to good communication with cross-functional teams - a key to successful development, and it’s something I value deeply and want to work at.

## For the reader
This repository showcases my progress in taking the project from development to deployment. I have had previous extensive experience, but this repository only contains my latest forward work. If there's any way I can assist or collaborate with you, feel free to reach out via direct message.

## Content
A time line of my deep dive into Front-End development - and translating the results into real world value.

## Problems solved

In my front-end journey, I've encountered problem solving in the following key areas:
- React UI rendering lifecycle & Next Request Cycle, for development speed.
- Defining clear boundary between client components and server actions, for scalability.
- Implementing Smooth UI Transitions that follow UX principles, for improving overall user engagement.

## Best practices
- [x] structure clean, maintainable code for a responsive website using Git workflow, environmental variables, A/B testing, and a consistent folder structure.
- [x] define clear KPIs for actionable items
