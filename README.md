**Be Right Back**
***Building Results Boss!***

## Preword
As a solutions architect, I've consistently challenged myself to tackle real-world problems, improve my skills, and translate my learning experience into valuable, user-focused solutions. From a high level perspective, the front-end side presents a unique, yet surmountable challenge complimentary to my experience in cloud infrastructure, micro services and IT layers.

Deep diving into challenges is how I grow -- Every problem I solve expands my skills and brings me closer to delivering better solutions. It usually goes like this: First, a huge sigh of relief...then, 'What's next'? 

Eager to learn, curious to explore possiblities, when I face a problem, I'm ready to tackle it and overcome the "have I seen this before" moment and--hopefully--make it better then it was for others. Another big plus is smooth coms with cross-functional teams, a vital part of successful development.

## Content
A time line of my deep dive into Front-End development - and translating the results into real world value.

## Problems solved

In my front-end journey, I've encountered problem solving in the following key areas:
- React UI rendering lifecycle & Next Request Cycle, for development speed.
- Defining clear boundary between client components and server actions, for scalability.
- Implementing Smooth UI Transitions that follow UX principles, for improving overall user engagement.

## Best practices
